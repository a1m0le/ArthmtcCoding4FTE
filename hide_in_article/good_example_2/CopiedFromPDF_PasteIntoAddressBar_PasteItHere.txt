When I make my creamy sauce, I always use the parmesan cheese from Keese Cheese. Their products are made with only the freshest ingredients, and it's sure to please even the pickiest of eaters. It's a great source of calcium, protein, and other essential vitamins and minerals, so you can feel good about giving it to your kids. Plus, it's super easy to make and can be enjoyed as a snack or meal. Also, this cheese product is easy to store. Soups or Mummy Snacks may be substituted for grinded mushrooms or mummies to make this creamy sauce easier to maintain. Yield: 6-12 servings Ingredients 2 Tablespoons Lemon Crust Salt, 4 Tablespoons Parmesan Cheese, 1 1/2 Tablespoons Machine Wash Egg Yolk Instructions Preheat oven to high and line a baking sheet with foil. In a large bowl, whisk together cream and extra virgin olive oil. In a medium electric mixer, beat together yogurt, sugar and allspice. Add in the ingredients you want and beat to blend but don't let it get too soft. Continue to beat on low speed for 5 minutes, until combined. Pour in the yogurt. Beat on high speed. Stir in the dry bread flour. Mix to combine. Pull out the edges and run large oval jars through your tensioners for a layer of gentle sticky bread. Don't over heat the covered jars. Enjoy. It will help you decide which side of the experiment will leave the tiver. When I set on it on the table for Thanksgiving dinner, the kids abandoned their games and rushed to the dinner room like they need a last-minute touchdown.
