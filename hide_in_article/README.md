So I think there are 4 issues with even the enhanced version of the e2e

1. It seems to be inevitably long. Making it as a tweet or chat message really limit the cipher text choices. Also its length makes it sus.
2. Unless we pick the seed very carefully, the text can easily be out of context and look suspicious.
3. Also, if the generated text is the only text transmitted, it can be isolated and attacked.
4. Hard to know when it really reads not like an AI generated when it is the only text around.
5. In case that censors think it is AI generated, if the scenario is chatting or tweeting, if will be very sus because few people AI generate those things.

Possible solution:
Use articles.

Blend the text in the middle of an Article.

So....
1. Articles are naturally long
2. If we generate the text in the middle, it can have some context in our control
3. Unless the attacker knows where the covert text starts, they have to do brute force to isolate out a sus portion
4. If the article is long enough, people might not really read it or miss out the part that is AI generated.
5. It is getting more and more popular to have AI generated articles. It can be hard for them to decide if this is a covert message or just some authors being lazy. Since the text before and after our cover text can be written by us, it should make it less sus.
