Linux is a clean, fast, and widespread open source Unix. For many years, though, the idea of something as well documented in terms of an open source Unix project in a particular language had been required to justify the common use of open source Unix in many places, whether for commercial or academic use or commercial and competitive use across all lines. In recent years, I have experienced a more dignified awakening to the concept of the open source community. No longer and without some ephemeral glee in my voice, I couldn't see my way out of the armchair of competing efforts and debates arguing each other out of existence, though it was certainly painful. However, my country is adept at the art of steering clear of obvious players. Of the 28,000 members who have pledged their support so far for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, only 1,500 have had one word of encouragement from the open source community, while millions have worse intentions.
