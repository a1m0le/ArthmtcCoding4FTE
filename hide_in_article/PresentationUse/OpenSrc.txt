Microsoft Windows is probably the most popular piece of closed-source operating system out there. Being closed-source, Microsoft maintains the rights to every bit of code it has written, or bought, and does not allow others to use that code in their products. However, It does cause trouble to users. For example, no Windows user can take the Windows 7 interface, modify it, and make it work properly on Windows 8. On the other hand, we have Linux. Linux is a clean, fast, and widespread open source Unix. For many years, though, the idea of something as well documented in terms of an open source Unix project in a particular language had been required to justify the common use of open source Unix in many places, whether for commercial or academic use or commercial and competitive use across all lines. In recent years, I have experienced a more dignified awakening to the concept of the open source community. No longer and without some ephemeral glee in my voice, I couldn't see my way out of the armchair of competing efforts and debates arguing each other out of existence, though it was certainly painful. However, my country is adept at the art of steering clear of obvious players. Of the 28,000 members who have pledged their support so far for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, only 1,500 have had one word of encouragement from the open source community, while millions have worse intentions. Those involvements are the reasons why I am having second thoughts about open source. Being closed-source may have some problems, but it can keep me away from all those.
